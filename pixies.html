    <h1>Pixies</h1>
    <p>I think the Pixies are like a funny combination of aggressive noise and sweet pop melodies. It’s kind of like throwing things 
        together that shouldn't go together, and seeing what happens. We were kind of a weird band. We did things that didn’t make sense, 
        and we didn’t care if it worked or not. The idea was to make something different, something raw. It’s not about making songs that 
        fit some formula. It's about pushing boundaries, making sounds that are unexpected, sometimes disturbing, but always interesting.
